							<p>At one of the Picture Halls at C Scheme area of Jaipur, the hilarious comedy "Andaz Apna Apna" (Amir Khan-Salman Khan-Paresh Rawal starter) enthralled the audience by involving every one. The entire hall was bursting into laughter very frequently and thoroughly enjoying all the senses. The story was also interesting. It was only Mr. Ajay Simbha, who was in the picture hall with his family members did not enjoy at all. He was only physically present. His mind was in turmoil. That day, Mr. Simbha, as promised to his wife and two children, reached early to home and they all went to that picture on that evening. After the picture, they all had gone to a restaurant. While all his family members enjoyed the food, he had no taste. Mrs. Simbha, however, was observing him to be in a bad mood even while he was driving the car. In the picture hall also she saw him tensed up and his concentration was deviated somewhere. He had not enjoyed the picture at all. His children also had seen him that something went wrong with their papa. He was always cheerful and cracking some jokes with his children, especially when he was on the dinning table. As Mrs. Simbha observed him that something went wrong, she spoke to him on that night. "What has gone wrong with you? You are not in regular moods. Where has your cheer gone? Our children have also observed that something is wrong with you."</p>

							<p>Mr. Ajay Simbha, M.Sc.in Geography joined Maheshwari Public School, a private +2 school affiliated to Central Board of Secondary Education of all India fame. Promotion came to him in quick succession and he rose to the position of HOD (Science) by dint of his hard work and through knowledge in his subject. He handled most complicated situations and had excellent knowledge on various CBSE rules and regulations. He was also sent to various seminars to get on-the-job training. He received school's prestigious "Best Teacher Award" twice which was presented to him by the Chairman of school.</p>

							<p>One Mr. Umesh Sharma, a close friend of Mr. Ajay Simbha started a small coaching Centre near his home two years back with 10 students and was teaching those Social Sciences. On the request of Mr. Sharma, Mr. Simbha was assisting him whenever he had faced any problem. The Centre earned good name and added 15 more students. Mr. Ajay Simbha, who was going there initially for some advices, started going regularly in his off time. With Mr. Ajay Simbha's association, the Centre grew very fast and started earning good profits. He was also receiving a handsome amount every month from Mr. Umesh Sharma. Though some management men had little knowledge on his part-time engagement, they did not much bother as he was regularly promoted and doing his duties to the highest satisfaction of all.</p>

							<p>A vacancy of Vice Principal occurred a few months back due to opening of a new school by the Society. As per rules of the society, the post was advertised and several people from inside and outside applied. In the interview, however, though seniority had some weightage, the total performance in the past years was the main criteria. Mr. Ajay Simbha topped in the interview and was promoted as Vice Principal.</p>

							<p>During his probation period, his performance was not up to the mark. He was leaving the school campus frequently early to fulfill certain commitments at Mr. Umesh Sharma's coaching center. Once at about 1 p.m., he received a telephone call from Mr. Umesh Sharma's center that he was urgently required. He wanted to leave and prepared a gate pass for his personal work. The Principal was in a meeting with the management so he took the signature of his subordinate and left the school. The Management took a serious note of this and he was verbally cautioned not to repeat this type of indecent act in future.</p>

							<p>After completion of almost six months of his probationary period, he was given a letter by Management informing that his job as Vice Principal was not satisfactory and unless he improves his performance, he might not be confirmed. Mr. Ajay Simbha was shocked. For the first time in his career in that society, he received a letter of that nature. He was known for his ability, talent and meticulous care. His morale reached at the lowest point. A highly dedicated, loyal, and committed employee, Mr. Ajay Simbha sentiment experienced rough whether for the first time in his life. Although, he knew that at times, his non-participation in executing some important orders and assignments annoyed his superiors, he did not anticipate a letter of this nature from Management. He stood for sometime with that letter in that office and went to his chamber. Sat down and read the letter again and again. He was reminiscing starting his first day as teacher.</p>

							<p>Mr. Ajay Simbha did not inform to his wife about this letter and his worries. But she saw him to be inattentive to general domestic matters. She could only guess that something might be wrong with his official duty and he would become normal very soon. On the last day of his probationary period, he was confident to receive his confirmation letter and promised his family to go out in the evening for a picture and dinner outside. Yes, he received a letter on that day from the Management. To his utter dismay, the letter mentioned that he failed to come up to the standard of Vice Principal in spite of their repeated verbal cautions to improve his performance. The Management, which gave him best opportunities, was disappointed. They, therefore, demoted him with effect from the same date and changed his designation as PGT (Post Graduate Teacher). He was upset and demoralized. He felt that he was insulted.</p>

							<p>This was the cause for his worry. He felt ashamed so bad that he could not even reveal the contents of that letter to his wife. After some persuasion, he spoke to his wife on that night. He narrated to her the contents of the letter and about his demotion. He, however, told her not to worry and sleep. He spent a sleepless night. Next morning, he sent in his resignation letter to his management.</p>
