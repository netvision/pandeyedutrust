							Hello friends! If you missed CBSE's official Examination Reforms 2026 webinar, this article gives you a complete and practical summary. The Board has introduced major operational changes, especially On-Screen Marking (OSM) for Class 12.
						</p>

						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
							The message from CBSE is clear: this is not only exam modernization, it is assessment-system modernization. With more than 31,000 affiliated schools and lakhs of students, 2026 marks one of the largest procedural transitions in CBSE history.
						</p>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							Who Addressed the Webinar
						</h3>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
							<li>Chairperson Shri Rahul Singh (vision and scale of reforms)</li>
							<li>Controller of Examinations Dr. Sanyam Bhardwaj (portal and workflow demonstration)</li>
							<li>Senior officials including Shri Manish Agarwal (NEP-2020 alignment)</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							Two Board Exam Opportunities for Class 10
						</h3>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
							CBSE confirmed two examination opportunities for Class 10 students in the same session.
						</p>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
							<li>Students may reappear in the second exam for improvement</li>
							<li>The better score will be reflected in the final marksheet</li>
							<li>Both scores remain visible for transparency</li>
							<li>LOC reopening is planned after the first attempt</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							Class 10 vs Class 12 Evaluation in 2026
						</h3>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Class 10 continues with physical/manual evaluation in 2026, but with structural improvements in answer book handling. The biggest reform is for Class 12, where evaluation is now digital through OSM.
						</p>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
							<li>Approx. 18.59 lakh Class 12 students</li>
							<li>Nearly 1 crore answer books</li>
							<li>Around 120 subjects under digital evaluation workflow</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							How OSM Works
						</h3>
						<ol class="list-decimal pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
							<li>Students write exams on paper as usual</li>
							<li>Answer books are sent to scanning centres</li>
							<li>Pages are scanned and uploaded to secure CBSE servers</li>
							<li>Evaluators receive randomized digital copies for marking</li>
							<li>Marks are awarded and verified online</li>
						</ol>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
							CBSE expects scanning completion in about 8 days and evaluation in about 8–9 days. Automated checks reduce totaling and unchecked-question errors significantly.
						</p>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							OSM Portal Features and Roles
						</h3>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
							<li>Secure login using user ID/password with OTP</li>
							<li>Evaluator/Assistant Examiner, Head Examiner, and Validation teams</li>
							<li>Right-click marking tools, icons, auto-totaling, mandatory completion checks</li>
							<li>Time and marking-pattern tracking for consistency</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
							CBSE has advised all teachers to complete practice sessions using demo credentials before actual evaluation duty.
						</p>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							Technical and Security Requirements
						</h3>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
							<li>Static public IP is required</li>
							<li>Laptops are allowed; webcam is not mandatory</li>
							<li>Auto-save and manual save both available</li>
							<li>CCTV monitoring with 3-month recording retention at centres</li>
							<li>Strict rules on mobiles/electronics and conduct discipline</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							Urgent Deadlines Shared in Webinar
						</h3>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
							<li>Internal assessment upload: 14–15 February 2026</li>
							<li>Query submission deadline: 14 February, 5 PM</li>
							<li>Expected evaluation start: around 26 February 2026</li>
							<li>Initial payment release: 17 February</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							Key Takeaways for Schools and Teachers
						</h3>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
							<li>2026 is the first major digital evaluation year for Class 12</li>
							<li>Class 10 remains manual with improved structure</li>
							<li>OSM aims to improve fairness, speed, and transparency</li>
							<li>Schools must act quickly on compliance and staff briefing</li>
							<li>Teachers should update OSS profile and complete practice marking</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							Final Advice
						</h3>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
							CBSE has taken a major step toward a transparent, technology-driven examination ecosystem. The success of this reform depends on timely preparation by schools and confident adaptation by teachers.
						</p>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
							For educators, this is adaptation time. For students, this is fairness time. For the education system, this is the beginning of a more reliable assessment future.
