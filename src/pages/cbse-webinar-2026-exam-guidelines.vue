							Hello friends!Did you miss yesterday’s CBSE webinar on the Examination Reforms 2026, or don’t have time to watch the 2–3 hour video?
						</p>

						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
							Pandey Education Trust has compiled all the major and structural changes in the Board Exams 2026 in this blog. We have explained the new On-Screen Marking (OSM), exam guidelines, and important deadlines in a simple and clear manner.
						</p>

						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
							Please read the article carefully — it is very informative and especially useful for teachers, principals, and examination staff.Also, do check our previous blogs on OSM and the Static IP requirement for CBSE evaluation.
						</p>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							A Major Change Is Coming to CBSE Board Exams
						</h3>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
							If you are a CBSE teacher, principal, coordinator, or examination in-charge, the 2026 board examination session is not a routine one. CBSE has officially introduced a digital evaluation system called On-Screen Marking (OSM) that will change how answer sheets are checked, how results are prepared, and how fairness in marking is ensured.
						</p>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">
							On 13 February 2026, CBSE Headquarters conducted a nationwide webinar (around 2–3 hours long) to brief all stakeholders — schools, centre superintendents, and teachers — about the new examination procedures for Classes 10 and 12.
						</p>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-2">The message from the Board was very clear:</p>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-6">CBSE is not merely modernizing exams; it is modernizing the entire assessment system.</p>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
							With more than 31,000 affiliated schools and lakhs of students, this reform is one of the biggest operational changes in the history of CBSE examinations.
						</p>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							Who Addressed the Webinar
						</h3>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">The session was led by senior CBSE officials:</p>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
							<li>Chairperson Shri Rahul Singh — explained the vision, scale, and transformation</li>
							<li>Controller of Examinations Dr. Sanyam Bhardwaj — demonstrated the digital marking portal and workflow</li>
							<li>Other officials including Shri Manish Agarwal — linked the reform with NEP-2020</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
							The webinar included live portal demonstrations, marking simulations, and detailed clarifications of doubts raised by schools.
						</p>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							Two Board Exam Opportunities in 2026
						</h3>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
							CBSE confirmed that Class 10 students will get two chances to appear in board examinations during the same academic session.
						</p>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-2">Key points:</p>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
							<li>Students may appear in the second exam to improve performance</li>
							<li>The better score will be reflected in the final marksheet</li>
							<li>Both scores will remain visible for transparency</li>
							<li>For Class 10, the List of Candidates (LOC) will reopen after the first exam attempt so improvement can be facilitated smoothly.</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
							This policy aims to reduce exam fear and make assessment more learning-oriented instead of one-day performance based.
						</p>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							Changes in Class 10 (Physical Evaluation Continues)
						</h3>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-4">
							Class 10 will still follow manual checking in 2026, but CBSE has introduced structural improvements:
						</p>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
							<li>Science and Social Science answer books are divided into subject-wise sections</li>
							<li>Only the relevant subject teacher will evaluate that portion</li>
							<li>Maps and diagrams will be placed at the end of answer books</li>
							<li>These changes also prepare the system for future digital evaluation.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							The Biggest Reform: On-Screen Marking (OSM) for Class 12
						</h3>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">This is the centrepiece of CBSE Board Exams 2026.</p>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-2">Approximately:</p>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
							<li>18.59 lakh Class 12 students</li>
							<li>Nearly 1 crore answer books</li>
							<li>About 120 subjects</li>
							<li>Instead of physically transporting answer sheets to evaluation centres, CBSE will adopt digital checking.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							What Actually Happens
						</h3>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
							<li>Students write exams on paper as usual</li>
							<li>Answer books go to scanning centres</li>
							<li>Every page is scanned</li>
							<li>Uploaded to secure CBSE servers</li>
							<li>Evaluators receive randomized digital copies for marking</li>
							<li>Marks are awarded online</li>
							<li>Teachers will not receive physical bundles of copies anymore.</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-2">CBSE expects:</p>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
							<li>Scanning completion: about 8 days</li>
							<li>Evaluation: about 8–9 days (earlier about 12 days)</li>
							<li>Because totaling and unchecked-question errors disappear, post-result mark verification for Class 12 will largely not be required.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							How the OSM Portal Works
						</h3>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-8">
							Teachers will evaluate through the official OSS/OSM digital platform.
						</p>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-2">Login System</p>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
							<li>User ID and password</li>
							<li>OTP authentication</li>
							<li>Profile update mandatory</li>
							<li>CBSE will provide practice credentials and demo answer books. Teachers are strongly advised to practice before real evaluation.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							Roles in Digital Evaluation
						</h3>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
							<li>Evaluator / Assistant Examiner (AE): Performs question-wise marking</li>
							<li>Head Examiner (H): Supervises and resolves mismatches</li>
							<li>Validation/CNS Team: Monitors marking patterns and accuracy</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							Marking Features
						</h3>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-2">The digital interface includes:</p>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-6 space-y-2">
							<li>Right-click marking (0.5, 1, 1.5, 2 etc.)</li>
							<li>Tick, cross, blank, and NA icons</li>
							<li>Automatic totaling</li>
							<li>Mandatory marking of unattempted questions</li>
							<li>Automatic selection of best answers in over-attempts</li>
							<li>The system will not allow submission if any question remains unchecked.</li>
						</ul>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-2">It also tracks:</p>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
							<li>Time spent per question</li>
							<li>Marking behaviour</li>
							<li>Deviations from normal marking</li>
							<li>This makes evaluation standardized across the country.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							Technical Requirements
						</h3>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-2">CBSE clarified several important points:</p>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
							<li>Laptops allowed</li>
							<li>No webcam required</li>
							<li>Auto-save + manual save available</li>
							<li>Power or internet interruption manageable</li>
							<li>Static IP Required</li>
							<li>Head examiners will handle wrong sets, blank pages, and re-scans.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							Examination Conduct &amp; Security Rules
						</h3>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-2">CBSE emphasized strict discipline at exam centres:</p>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
							<li>CCTV monitoring with 3-month recording retention</li>
							<li>Gender-appropriate frisking</li>
							<li>No mobile phones or electronic devices</li>
							<li>No seat change or subject swap</li>
							<li>Immediate reporting of irregularities</li>
							<li>CBSE announced zero tolerance for unfair means (UFM) and advised schools to brief students and parents properly.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							Responsibilities of Principals and Schools
						</h3>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-3">The principal, acting as Centre Superintendent, holds primary responsibility.</p>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-2">Schools must:</p>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
							<li>Maintain discipline and confidentiality</li>
							<li>Submit answer books on time</li>
							<li>Follow Standard Operating Procedures (SOPs)</li>
							<li>Ensure staff briefing and student awareness</li>
							<li>Duty conflicts must be avoided (e.g., one person cannot be both evaluator and centre superintendent).</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							Urgent Deadlines Schools Must Note
						</h3>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-2">CBSE highlighted immediate actions:</p>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
							<li>Internal assessment upload: 14–15 February 2026</li>
							<li>Query submission deadline: 14 February, 5 PM</li>
							<li>Evaluation expected to start: around 26 February 2026</li>
							<li>Initial payment release: 17 February</li>
							<li>CBSE reported that nearly 30% of schools had not uploaded internal assessments, which may affect results.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							Benefits of the New System
						</h3>
						<h4 class="text-xl font-semibold text-primary-600 mt-6 mb-3">For Students</h4>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							Practical Concerns Addressed by CBSE
						</h3>
						<p class="leading-relaxed mb-2">The Board also discussed real issues:</p>
						<ul class="list-disc pl-6 mb-8 space-y-2">
							<li>Eye strain → breaks permitted</li>
							<li>Power cuts → manual save recommended</li>
							<li>Learning curve → practice sessions available</li>
							<li>Workload → limited initial copies</li>
							<li>Teachers should practice evaluating 3–4 sample answer books before actual duty.</li>
						</ul>

						<h3 class="text-2xl font-heading font-bold text-neutral-900 mt-8 mb-4">
							What This Reform Really Means
						</h3>
